			<p class="textbox"> 
				I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh in my last semester of obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My most proficient languages are Java and Python. I have worked on large projects in both languages. I currently work at my university's IT help desk and I have interned as a software engineer at Bentley Systems where I worked on a code playground to be hosted on the company's website. I have experience with web development. I have done freelance work with creating an HTTP server in Python by using HTML and Javascript.
