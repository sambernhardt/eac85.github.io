			<p class="textbox"> 

				I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My most proficient languages are Java and Python. I currently work at my university's IT help desk and I have interned as a software engineer at Bentley Systems where I worked on a code playground to be hosted on the company's website. I have experience with web development. I have done freelance work with creating an HTTP server in Python by using HTML and Javascript.

				<strong class="name"> McKESSON </strong> <br> As a software engineer, I work primarily use Java and SQL to work on their pharmaceutical software. I fix defects and implementing new features in an Agile environment. My most important project was creating a batch job that predicts when a pharmacy might run out of Rx Numbers, causing timeout in the application and store shut down.

				<a href="https://imodeljs.github.io/iModelJs-docs-output/learning/codeplaygrounds/?term=play"> <strong class="name"> BENTLEY SYSTEMS </strong> </a>  <br> I enhanced the company's website by developing a code playground for their iModelJS team. The iModelJS team is responsible for managing a javascript library that accompanies their software for infrastructure. The code playground's purpose is to draw more customers into the website to learn more about their library and what their software can do. It will also be used in tutorials to teach their users more about how to incorporate all their libraries.
