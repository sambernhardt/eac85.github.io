<p> My mother and I have checked off the majority of the "must-sees" of Pittsburgh since I started attending Pitt. One rainy Sunday afternoon with my mother in the driver's seat, I googled "hidden gems of Pittsburgh" and found a link to the Row House Cinema. It sounded fun and I had never been to that section of the city, so we followed the GPS to our destination. With an hour or so to kill, and the rain letting up, we went in and out of quirky shop until we were smitten with Lawrenceville.</p> <p> Since that day, I have revisited Lawrenceville twice and told multiple people about its quirks and cute shops. Many people have never been there since Pitt kids have such tunnel vison for Shady Side and South Side. Well - it's time to find a new side and visit Lawrenceville. My third visit allowed me to see the things I didn't notice before -- all of the side walk signs, featured in my image gallery. I was taking pictures and talked to several people about what I was doing. A man jokingly asked if I had gotten a picture of him and I said "No, would you like one?" and he replied "Nah, baby. Have a good day!" So go to Lawrenceville and have a good day.</p>
