<a href="http://www.arsenalbowl.com/"> <b> Arsenal Bowl </b> </a> Although I have never been here, this place looks really cool from the outside. And after some research, I think the inside follows suit. They offer affordable deals like $8 all you can bowl nights, 50 cent shoe rentals and bowling alley food. You can enjoy their DJs, live bands, and game nights with a crowd that's 21 and up. I have to wait a little over a year to get in to one of the 21+ events, but I am interested in planning a trip with my friends. It seems like a fun place to get away from the usual things to do in Oakland.

<p> <img src="mainlogo.png" style="width: 30%; float:right; margin-bottom:25px; padding-left: 10px"> <a href="http://www.rowhousecinema.com"> <b> Row House Cinema </b> </a> as mentioned on the first page, this is what originally brought us to Lawrenceville. Its atmosphere is hard to describe. We walked in under its brightly lit marquee to a dim hallway that led us to concession stand. I got my usual movie snack, sour patch kids. They offered beer and popcorn and other movies concessions. After we bought our tickets, we walked in to a small theater, much like one we have in my home town. Each week they play a specific set of films. They were showing “Welcome to America” the night we were there. I was pleased that there were few previews, and the movie started promptly. The theater laughed together at the funny parts. I could tell that many of them had seen it before because of their reactions to what seemed like their favorite scenes - laughed loud before it even happened. It did not match my mom's sense of humor, but we like to do things for the experience - and an experience it was. With Halloween coming up, they are showing a handful of holiday-related movies to get you into the spirit. It reminded me of the one at home - the only difference being that the Cinema house had hipster vibes and a partner store, Bierfest.
